    "A **Random Forest Regressor** is an ensemble learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs the average prediction of all the trees. Each tree in the forest is trained on a random subset of the data, and the final prediction is made by averaging the predictions from all the trees in the forest.\n",

    "- **Bootstrap sampling**: Each decision tree is trained on a different random subset (with replacement) of the data, which prevents the model from being too sensitive to individual data points.\n",
    "- **Random feature selection**: When splitting nodes, only a random subset of features is considered, which further reduces the chance of overfitting.\n",
    "- **Averaging of predictions**: By aggregating the predictions of multiple trees, random forest smoothens the final output, reducing the impact of overfitting from any individual tree.\n",
